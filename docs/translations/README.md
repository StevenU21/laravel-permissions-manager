# Translations

The **Laravel Permissions Manager** comes with a built-in translation engine designed to make your UI developer-friendly and user-friendly.

It bridges the gap between technical permission names (e.g. `create users`) and human-readable interfaces (e.g. "Create Users" or "Crear Usuarios").
